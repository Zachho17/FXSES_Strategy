Summary:
{Final version of the codes are saved in the file with the name "(dataframe)" at the back}

The underlying idea of this trading strategy is built upon an observation of patterns on price data
The pattern is derived from comparing the respective trading range from Tokyo session, to London session then to New York session
	
If there are three consective higher highs (i.e. New York high was higher than London high, which was also higher than Tokyo high)
(vice versa for lower lows)

There seems to be some degree of price continuation/follow through if such patterns have been observed.
So I have decided to develop a backtesting logic using Reuters intraday data, which is available through the CodeBook function in Reuters.

The goal is to explore if trading such price continuation could generate consistent profit.
(buy when three consective higher highs observed, sell when three consective lower lows observed)
Backtesting is then applied to multiple different currencies, in a attempt to observe if the strategy works better for one than the others.

It has been concluded that such strategy goes not generate consistent profit in the currencies being tested within the backtest period.
However, one could argue that the backtesting period is just merely 12 months(constraints from Reuters), which might still be within one specific market regime*.
*Namely, in certain market regime, currencies tend to move in range and lack of follow through in price action.

More intraday data, ideally across multiple market regimes, could determine if such strategy works better in certain market regimes than the others.
Or we can declare the strategy to be completely useless.
However, this would lead to the need to identify market regime in the specific period. This can well be my next project. 


The data:
Intraday data of mid price her hour is extracted using the API from Reuters, which only has maximum of one year worth of intraday hourly data.
The data is indexed with timestamp, and generated as a dataframe. The data is a time series data.


The strategy & programming workflow:
- Segregate Tokyo session, London session and New York session
- Determine the respective highs and lows of three sessions
- If a trading signal is confirmed (either 3 higher highs or 3 lower lows) and no open trade, open a long/short trade at 8am Asian time
- Stop Loss (SL) set using London's high/low, determined by the direction of the trade (if long, use London low as SL. If short, use London high as SL.)
- Take Profit (TP) set with the risk reward ratio of 1:1, i.e. if SL is 50 pips below the long entry, the TP is 50 pips above the long entry
- Open trade will be evaluated against both SL and TP level every hour, to determine whether to close the trade
- Once the trade is closed, the respective Profit and Loss will be saved in a list
- Performance matrix would be evaluated on the list, and a final performance summary would be generated into a dataframe


The challenges:
- Data indexed in timestamp
	test
- Unconvenient timestamp data across weekend
	etset
- Open-trade evaluation
